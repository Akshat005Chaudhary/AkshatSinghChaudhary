I am a backend-focused developer with strong problem-solving skills, solid reasoning ability, and expertise in server-side logic.

I bring with me a high level of commitment, discipline, and work ethics, with a proven record of delivering results. My experience includes working on multiple projects using in-demand technologies such as Node.js and Express.js.

Currently, I am deepening my expertise in databases to strengthen my technical foundation and enhance my marketability. Looking ahead, I am particularly interested in web application security and blockchain, areas where I intend to combine my backend expertise to create a powerful and future-ready skill set for any organization I contribute to.

Enjoy!
